QR Code Project Description
The QR Code project is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to generate and scan QR codes easily. A QR (Quick Response) code is a two-dimensional barcode that stores information such as text, URLs, or other data, which can be quickly accessed by scanning the code with a smartphone or camera.

In this project, users can input any text or link, and the application generates a corresponding QR code dynamically, which can be displayed and saved as an image. Additionally, the project includes a scanning feature that utilizes the deviceâ€™s camera to detect and decode QR codes in real-time, displaying the extracted information instantly.

This project demonstrates the practical use of modern web technologies to provide an interactive and user-friendly tool for encoding and decoding information via QR codes, which have widespread applications in digital payments, marketing, event ticketing, and more.
